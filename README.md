## Introduction  
**Code Realm** is a comprehensive desktop software solution designed to assist users in coding, learning programming languages, and participating in online contests. Developed using JavaFX and integrated with MySQL, this tool offers a clean and feature-rich environment that combines code editing, tutorial access, contest tracking, and code sharing. The platform aims to simplify and centralize the programming experience for students, educators, and enthusiasts.

## Objective  
The primary goal of Code Realm is to minimize the need for multiple tools and websites by providing a single application that supports learning, coding, and contest preparation. Users can:
- Learn different programming languages with access to curated tutorials and videos.
- Write, compile, and run code in languages such as C++, Java, and Python.
- Track upcoming coding contests from platforms like Codeforces.
- Save and share their code easily using integrated APIs.
- Create and manage personal profiles within a secure login system.

This software enhances productivity by streamlining key tasks into one efficient environment.

## Technologies Used  
- **JavaFX**: For building the user interface.  
- **NetBeans 17**: As the main development environment.  
- **JDK 20**: Java Development Kit used for compiling and running Java code.  
- **MySQL Server**: For managing the user database and storing code links.
